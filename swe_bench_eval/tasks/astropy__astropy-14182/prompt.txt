**Repository:** astropy/astropy
**Base Commit:** a5917978be39d13cd90b517e1de4e7a539ffaa48

## Problem Statement

Please support header rows in RestructuredText output
### Description

It would be great if the following would work:

```Python
>>> from astropy.table import QTable
>>> import astropy.units as u
>>> import sys
>>> tbl = QTable({'wave': [350,950]*u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2]*u.count})
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.rst")
===== ========
 wave response
===== ========
350.0      0.7
950.0      1.2
===== ========
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.fixed_width", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
|  wave | response |
|    nm |       ct |
| 350.0 |      0.7 |
| 950.0 |      1.2 |
>>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])

```


### Additional context

RestructuredText output is a great way to fill autogenerated documentation with content, so having this flexible makes the life easier `:-)`




## Hints (if needed)



## Your Task

1. Explore the codebase to understand the issue
2. Locate the relevant files mentioned in the problem
3. Analyze the code and identify what needs to be changed
4. Implement a fix for the issue
5. Explain your solution

Note: You're working in a sandbox environment. The actual repository code needs to be set up manually.
